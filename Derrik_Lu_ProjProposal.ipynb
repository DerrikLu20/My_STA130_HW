    "- Variables: (a) Self-rated intelligence and reported frequency/severity of depression. (b) A scatter plot that can visualize correlations, and bar charts of grouped intelligence levels vs. mean depression scores may highlight some trends.\n",
    "- Analysis: (a) Correlation Tests: For each pair, Pearson or Spearman correlation tests to determine association, assuming linearity in Pearsonâ€™s case.\n",
    "- (b) Possible Results: If a correlation is found, it could imply that self-image may play a role in emotional health, or the other way around, suggesting that perceptions of intelligence could impact mental well-being.\n",
    "- Relevance: This could raise awareness about the role of self-esteem and self-perception in mental health, supporting advocacy for mental health resources that address these areas."

    "- Variables: (a) A scatter plot or box plot can reveal if higher forgiveness levels correlate with greater worry.\n",
    "- Analysis: (a) Logistic Regression (for categorical responses): If laziness is binary (yes/no), logistic regression might be used, controlling for confounding variables.\n",
    "- Possible Results: (b) A positive correlation might suggest that those who are more forgiving tend to worry more about their relationships, possibly due to higher empathy or attachment.\n",
    "- Relevance: This could provide insight into emotional patterns tied to relationship quality, potentially informing social strategies that promote healthy emotional boundaries and forgiveness."

    "- Analysis: (a) Visuals: Explain how visualizations reveal trends, like group mean scores to indicate average relationships.\n",
    "- Possible Results: (b) If a link exists, it could imply that dietary habits influence perceptions of activity level, or that health-conscious individuals perceive or report their activity differently.\n",
    "- Relevance: This might uncover social perceptions tied to diet and lifestyle, supporting awareness on how lifestyle choices affect self-image and activity levels."
