Towards the end of the \"first pre-lecture\" video (above) it is stated that, \"It is important to note that outcomes of tests refer to the population parameter, rather than the sample statistic! As such, the result that we get is for the population.\" In terms of the distinctions between the concepts of $x_i\\!$'s, $\\bar x$, $\\mu$, and $\\mu_0$, how would you describe what the sentence above means?

    "When you get a small p-value, it means that the chance of seeing your data under the assumption that H₀ is true is very low. This is because if you have a high p-value (usually >0.05), it means that your data is consistent with the null hypothesis as its more random, supporting the null hypothesis. So, you do not reject the null hypothesis because the result looks like what you'd expect if the null hypothesis is true. If you have a low p-value (usually <0.05), it means your data is unlikely under the null hypothesis. In this case, you would consider rejecting the null hypothesis because the observed result seems too unusual to be just random chance."

    "This project is based on an adaptation of the famous \"Lady Tasting Tea\" experiment by Sir Ronald Fisher, where the ability to distinguish whether milk or tea was poured first is tested. In this modern experiment, we asked 80 STA130 students to identify whether tea or milk was poured first in a cup. Of these students, 49 correctly identified the pouring order. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether the performance of these students can be attributed to random guessing or if their ability to distinguish the order is statistically significant.\n",
